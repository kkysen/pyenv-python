# pyenv-python
A pyenv shim for python that's much faster than pyenv.

### Usage
This `python` shim, i.e., `$CARGO_HOME/bin/python`, 
loads much faster than `pyenv`'s `python` shim, which is written in Bash. 

This helps a lot when running CLI scripts in Python, 
since the time is takes to run the CLI script is often 
less than the time it takes `pyenv` to find `python`. 

For example, with `starship`, `python --version` is run every time 
when you're in a Python directory to display the current 
Python version on the prompt, but if `pyenv`'s `python` shim 
takes ~1 sec, it makes the prompt painfully slow.
Using this `python` shim, the time for `python --version` is unnoticeable.

### Performance
On my local computer, `$CARGO_HOME/bin/python --version` runs 
about 23x faster than `$PYENV_ROOT/shims/python --version`.

```

### Installation
It's just published to `crates.io`, so you need `cargo` from `rustup` to install. 

Then `cargo install pyenv-python` will install `python` and `python-path`.
For this `python` to wrap the `pyenv` `python` or the system `python`, 
it `$CARGO_HOME/bin` must be before any other `python`s in `$PATH`.
